# JK Rebase Issue
The issue is that JK does a pull and the default setting is rebase. Attempting to replicate the issue and then attempting to resolve. 

## Hypothesis
1. git config --global set to pull.rebase rather than pull.merge  
2. repo config (local) set to pull.rebase  
3. RStudio is doing something weird?


# Tests
1. Have JK clone repo, make change, have JK pull change. 
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Jessica was here 
=======
JK and I are making changes to the same line at the same time.
